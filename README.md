##  Milestone 1: Ideation

### Problem Motivation:
University students often face stress and burnout. Many tools focus solely on productivity, neglecting the social support that boosts motivation. Bud bridges this gap by promoting task tracking *and* buddy-based accountability.

### Proposed Core Features / User Stories:
- As a user, I can register/login securely to access my personalized dashboard.
- As a user, I can connect with a study buddy to share our progress.
- As a user, I can create subject-based to-do lists and track my study tasks.
- As a user, I want to feel motivated by seeing my buddyâ€™s study progress too.

### Design Plan:
#### Architecture Overview:
| Layer       | Technology          |
|------------|---------------------|
| Frontend   | React, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend    | Firebase (Auth + DB)|
| Database   | Firestore           |
| Hosting    | Vercel/Firebase     |

####  Features Completed:
- **Feature 1 (Level 1):** User registration and data stored in Firebase
